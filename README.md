# INT304 Image recognition with neural network on fashion MNIST dataset

**MLP**: Built a Multilayer Perception (MLP) topology; used Adam Boost in the backpropagation to expedite convergence speed; eventually achieved 88% accuracy in the test set

**SVM**: For SVM with a RBF kernel, the tuning hyperparameters are regularization C and kernel parameter gama. The final accuracy reached 89.69%

**KNN**: Only tuning hyper parameter is K; The final accuracy only got to 85.82%
